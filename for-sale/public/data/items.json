This may sound like a pure stoner comedy, but it transcends the genre: these characters struggle unsuccessfully to come to grips with their depression, drug use, sexuality, poverty, lack of work, lack of ambition, and their complex feelings about each other in ways that have made Megg and Mogg sensations on Hanselmann's GirlMountain tumblr. This is the first collection of Hanselmann's work, freed from its cumbersome Internet prison, and sure to be one of the most talked about graphic novels of 2014, featuring all of the \"classic\" Megg and Mogg episodes from the past five years as well as over 70 pages of all-new material."

        "description": "After enjoying over six months on the New York Times Bestseller list and receiving a rave review from the same institution, acclaimed cartoonist Adrian Tomine’s Killing and Dying is now available in paperback, with an updated cover and French flaps. With this work, Tomine (Shortcomings, Scenes from an Impending Marriage) reaffirms his place not only as one of the most significant creators of contemporary comics, but as one of the great voices of modern American literature. His gift for capturing emotion and intellect resonates: the weight of love and its absence, the pride and disappointment of family, the anxiety and hopefulness of being alive in the twenty-first century.\n\n\"Amber Sweet\" shows the disastrous impact of mistaken identity in a hyper-connected world; \"A Brief History of the Art Form Known as Hortisculpture\" details the invention and destruction of a vital new art form; \"Translated, from the Japanese,\" is a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images; the title story, \"Killing and Dying,\" centers on parenthood, mortality, and stand-up comedy. In six interconnected, darkly funny stories, Tomine forms a quietly moving portrait of contemporary life.\n\nAdrian Tomine is a master of the small gesture, equally deft at signaling emotion via a subtle change of expression or writ large across landscapes illustrated in full color. Killing and Dying is a fraught, realist masterpiece."

        "description": "It would be a massive understatement to say that the Super Nintendo (SNES) had a formidable act to follow when it arrived at the dawn of the 1990s. Nintendo's previous console, the NES (or Famicom, as it was known in its native Japan), enjoyed seven years of almost unrivalled dominance following its initial launch in Japan in 1983; by 1990 it had almost single-handedly rehabilitated the home video game market, turning Nintendo into a household name across the globe. focussing on the Super Famicom in Japan and the SNES across North America and Europe, SNES/Super Famicom: a visual compendium offers a visual snapshot of the best games, developers, box art and product design from across these territories. As the name suggests, we’ve concentrated on the stunning visuals contained in SNES/Famicom games, alongside text snapshots and anecdotes. The result is a visual companion designed to stir up excitement and nostalgia for this fantastic machine and its legacy of classic games. The SNES/Super Famicom: a visual compendium measures 170mm × 230mm and its 500+ pages are printed lithographically to the highest standards. This ensures that colours in the book are really vibrant and pages have a high-quality, luxurious feel to them. It also comes with four Super Famicom coloured bookmark ribbons and a 3mm protective board slipcase with animated-effect lenticular images."

We see the inevitable as the characters bicker or celebrate, unaware of what's coming. Throughout this dystopic graphic novel, Chippendale uses humor and a frantic drawing style to show how the insidious nature of corporate greed and the commodification of everything have warped society into a killing machine."

It also includes fully voiced English story dialogue, giving new depth to the cast of Devil Survivor 2's original story. Record Breaker requires no knowledge of the story from the original Devil Survivor, so newcomers to the series won't lack any crucial plot information. Just before the heralding of the apocalypse, when life was normal, some thrill-seekers were registering on a website that promised to deliver fake videos of their friends being killed. As people wondered what these videos could mean, an invasion began and humanity was forced to face a struggle to survive in an unprecedented catastrophe. For the main character and his friends, they stand up for humanity when the very same website uploads an application on their cell phones, summoning demons. From there, newly minted demon tamers begin the fight to survive and save the future of mankind, but the protagonist's decisions aren't without consequences. What he chooses may save the lives of his friends, or seal their fate."

It was originally released in 2012 and later rereleased as an expanded edition in 2013 subtitled For the Sequel in Japan. For the Sequel was later released in Europe, Australia, and North America in 2014 simply titled as Bravely Default and published by Nintendo in said regions. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system and job system, in addition to incorporating options to combine job abilities and adjust battle speed and random encounter rates. A high-definition remaster developed by Cattle Call, titled Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, was released as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.\nBravely Default is set in the world of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four elemental crystals protected by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a religious group with influence across the world. The story follows the adventures of four protagonists: Agnès Oblige, vestal of the Wind Crystal, who was forced out of her duties after the crystals were consumed by darkness; Tiz Arrior, the sole survivor from a destroyed village caused by the crystals' blight; Ringabel, an amnesiac wanderer trying to uncover the secrets of a mysterious journal in his possession; and Edea Lee, a defector from a large army bent on capturing Agnès. Together, the party aims to reclaim the four crystals from the darkness and confront a greater evil along the way.\nStarting development as an action role-playing sequel to Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light, it retained elements from the Final Fantasy series while having its own story and gameplay elements. The producer of The 4 Heroes of Light, Tomoya Asano, returned to produce Bravely Default. The story's writer was Naotaka Hayashi, who was brought in from 5pb. due to his work on Steins;Gate. The characters designs were handled by multiple artists, including art director Akihiko Yoshida and mangaka Atsushi Ōkubo. The game was influenced by western video games and television series, and individual elements were inspired by aspects of the Dragon Quest series and Higurashi When They Cry. The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended to evoke the feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa."

Hovercraft, tanks and infantry slug it out with tactical nuclear devices. But the most feared weapon of all needs no human guidance. It's a giant cybernetic tank called the OGRE.\n\nThe basic OGRE game gives one player a force of infantry and armor, and a command post he must defend. The other player has only one unit - but it's an OGRE. It's an even match. Advanced games allow solitaire or multi-player action, with OGREs on both sides."

        "title": "Fire Emblem Awakening",
        "description": "Fire Emblem Awakening is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. The game was released in Japan in April 2012 and North America and PAL regions in early 2013. It is an installment of the Fire Emblem series, and the first to be developed for the 3DS. The gameplay, like previous Fire Emblem games, focuses on the tactical movement of characters across a grid-based battlefield and fighting enemy units. Other features include the ability to build and foster relationships between characters to improve their abilities and multiple camera perspectives in battle.\nThe story is set 2000 years after the events of the original Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem Gaiden and focuses on Chrom, the prince of Ylisse, and his personal army, the \"Shepherds\". They rescue Robin, an amnesiac Avatar whose name, gender, and appearance can be customized by the player, and who takes on the role of their tactician. Over the course of the story, Chrom's army travels across Ylisse and defends it from undead invaders called the Risen and attacks from the hostile nation of Plegia.\nDevelopment of Fire Emblem Awakening began in 2010, with multiple veterans of the Fire Emblem series filling key development roles. Development was handled by Intelligent Systems with supervision from Nintendo. As the series had seen declining sales with previous installments, Awakening was designed as the possible last entry in the series, incorporating elements from all previous Fire Emblem games. Due to the 3DS still being fine-tuned by developers, the team's decisions for content and graphics were made based on what they thought was feasible on the hardware.\nUpon release, Fire Emblem Awakening received critical acclaim and strong sales worldwide, with many critics praising its overall presentation, story, cast of characters, new additions to the traditional gameplay and accessibility to newcomers. However, some gameplay options and proposals were met with mixed reception, such as the option to disable permanent character death, colloquially known as permadeath, a staple of the franchise. The game was nominated for multiple awards from video game publications, and is often cited as one of the best games on the 3DS and one of the greatest video games of all time. Its commercial success is also credited with boosting sales for the 3DS and ensuring the continuation of the Fire Emblem series. It was followed by Fire Emblem Fates in 2015."
